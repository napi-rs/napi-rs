/// `spawn_blocking`, `block_on`, and `within_runtime_if_available` names remain Tokio
/// compatibility APIs whenever `tokio_rt` is enabled, so Cargo feature unification cannot
/// silently change their signatures or routing; generated `#[napi] async fn` futures follow the
/// *selection* (the custom backend if one was registered before the window closed, otherwise
/// Tokio). Selecting and starting a custom backend does not construct Tokio; the first Tokio
/// compatibility helper call constructs it lazily. In a pure `async-runtime` build there is no
/// Tokio at all, and a missing-backend error before any environment is activated leaves the
/// selection undecided and does not prevent later registration.
///
/// Under the `noop` feature this SPI cannot be installed: [`try_register_async_runtime`] safely
/// retires the supplied backend and reports [`crate::Status::InvalidArg`], while the infallible
/// [`register_async_runtime`] wrapper retires it and preserves its no-op result.
///
/// The implementation is stored once per linked addon image and shared across its threads, hence
/// the `Send + Sync + 'static` bound. The backend's [`Drop`] implementation is not guaranteed to
/// run; [`shutdown`](AsyncRuntime::shutdown) is the sole resource-release and quiescence hook.
/// Keep a newly constructed backend dormant, create active resources in
/// [`start`](AsyncRuntime::start), and release them in `shutdown`. See
