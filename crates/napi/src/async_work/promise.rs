//! The promise an `AsyncTask` / `Env::spawn` hands to JavaScript, and how it is settled. The
//! promise of a `JsDeferred` (`#[napi] async fn`, `Env::spawn_future`, `Env::create_deferred`)
//! uses the same machinery, see [`DetachedPromise`].
//!
//! `napi_create_promise` hands back a `napi_deferred` that only `napi_resolve_deferred` /
//! `napi_reject_deferred` free. Both begin with `NAPI_PREAMBLE`, which refuses once the env can
//! no longer run JavaScript. A worker that is terminated while a task is queued or running still
//! runs the task's completion callback during teardown (Node drains the threadpool before it
//! frees the env), and a deferred settled there is never freed: 16 bytes of C++ heap per task,
//! per terminated worker, on every Node version.
//!
//! Each env settles its promises one of two ways ([`SettleMode`], `settle_mode.rs`), picked once,
//! at the env's first task or `JsDeferred` after this addon's registration into it has returned.
//! Not while it registers: the check reads `process.versions`, whose getter may load another
//! addon, and Node holds its addon-loader lock while an addon registers. That lock is not
//! re-entrant, so the nested load would abort the process. A task created while this addon registers (by module-init
//! code) takes the thenable path and decides nothing; so does a task created by a getter while
//! the check runs.
//!
//! * **Deferred**, where the env can only die with its process: the main env of Node (the env's
//!   loop is `uv_default_loop()`), the main env of Bun (it runs on the process main thread), and
//!   every wasm env (emnapi refuses JavaScript only after `Context.destroy()`; the refused
//!   deferred dies with the realm, or stays until process exit if the process continues after
//!   `beforeExit`, the same as before). The deferred is settled when the task completes, as
//!   before. A task still in flight when such an env is torn down leaks its deferred, which only
//!   happens on process exit there.
//! * **Thenable**, everywhere else: workers, Electron and NW.js (whose renderer envs are freed
//!   on navigation), Bun on Windows, Deno, and any host the check cannot place. Described
//!   below. It costs about 2 µs more main-thread CPU per task.
//!
//! Bun is placed by its OS thread, never by libuv. Bun before 1.4.4 exports `uv_default_loop`
//! as a stub that aborts the process, and `process.versions.bun` is writable, so no Bun ever
//! has `uv_default_loop()` called. On other Unix hosts it is called only when the host is
//! Node-based (it exports `node::Buffer::Data`). A faked `process.versions` can only move an env
//! to the other mode: more CPU, or the 16 B deferred leak of the code before #3689. It never
//! crashes the process or settles a promise wrongly. Windows is unchanged: Node, Electron and
//! Bun all have a real libuv there, Deno does not export `uv_default_loop`, and Bun takes the
//! thenable path because its main thread does not run the default loop there.
//!
//! In deferred mode a settling call behaves as before #3689: one that fails after Node freed the
//! deferred gives `Err(generic_failure)` or `Ok(false)` from [`conclude`] and the promise stays
//! pending; `napi_invalid_arg` from a null `napi_value` leaves the deferred unsettled; on WASI, a
//! replaced `globalThis.Promise` whose resolving functions throw leaves one emnapi deferred
//! reference and its promise pending.
//!
//! In thenable mode no deferred exists. [`create`] calls the env's *promise wrapper*, a function
//! compiled once per env, `(then, handle) => settle({ then, handle })` where `settle` is
//! `async (thenable) => thenable`, and hands out the promise it returns. That promise is resolved
//! with the object `settle` returns (the *thenable*): a fresh plain object whose own `then` data
//! property is a native function of this module. Resolving a promise with a thenable reads
//! `then` once, at once, and queues a job that later calls
//! `then.call(thenable, resolve, reject)` with the engine's own resolving functions for the
//! promise. The native `then` keeps them behind two `napi_ref`s, and the completion
//! callback settles the promise by calling one of them. `napi_delete_reference` has no
//! `NAPI_PREAMBLE` (Node and emnapi alike), so the references are deleted on every path,
//! including a settlement the env refused.
//!
//! Building the promise is one call that the env can refuse (`napi_call_function`), and nothing
//! native is allocated before it. `worker.terminate()` runs on the parent thread and can make the
//! env refuse JavaScript at any moment, so this matters: a refused call leaves nothing behind,
//! and a call that ran made a promise the GC owns.
//!
//! The wrapper costs, per env, one `napi_run_script` at the env's first thenable-mode promise (an
//! anonymous script, so the inspector reports one more `scriptParsed`) and one reference, deleted
//! at teardown. Calling it is a JavaScript call, so near the stack limit it can throw a
//! `RangeError` where `napi_create_promise` did not. It throws before any promise exists (the
//! `async` body only returns its argument), so that one promise is then made without the
//! wrapper, below, and the exception is cleared: no task fails to start, and none gets a promise
//! already rejected.
//!
//! Without the wrapper, a thenable-mode task creates a deferred and resolves it right away with
//! the thenable. A terminate that lands between those two calls leaks the deferred (16 B; at most
//! one per terminated worker, since every later `napi_create_promise` on that env is refused).
//! That path keeps that window. It is taken when the env has no registration record to keep the
//! wrapper in, when compiling or calling the wrapper fails (for this task only; the next task
//! tries again), and for good when the host blocks code generation (compiling threw an
//! `EvalError`). Node, Electron, Bun and Deno compile the wrapper with the engine's own script
//! compiler, which `--disallow-code-generation-from-strings` and a Content Security Policy
//! without `'unsafe-eval'` do not block.
//!
//! In thenable mode, nothing here reads a property user code can reach, and nothing calls user
//! code to build or settle the promise on Node: the promise is an `async` function's (made from
//! the intrinsic `%Promise%`, not `globalThis.Promise`), the function is called by
//! `napi_call_function` (not through `Function.prototype.call`), `then` is an own data property of
//! an object no script holds (an object literal defines it, so an `Object.prototype.then`
//! accessor or setter is never consulted), and `resolve` / `reject` are the built-in resolving
//! functions of this very promise. Only the inspector (`Runtime.queryObjects`) can reach the
//! thenable; calling its `then` first steals the promise's settlement, which then never happens.
//! A promise hook (`async_hooks`, `v8.promiseHooks`) does run user code while the promise is
//! made, as it does for `napi_create_promise`. It cannot reach the `then` function, the thenable
//! or the wrapper's functions (the wrapper is strict code, so a structured stack trace hides
//! them).
//! In deferred mode the task's value goes straight to `napi_resolve_deferred`, as before #3689,
//! so V8 reads `then` on an object value and an `Object.prototype.then` accessor runs there.
//!
//! On WASI, emnapi builds these calls in JavaScript: `napi_create_promise` uses the
//! `globalThis.Promise` of the moment, and `napi_call_function` uses the current
//! `Array.prototype.push` and `Function.prototype.apply`. Replacing those can run user code
//! while a task settles; a throwing replacement leaves the promise pending and its exception
//! reported as uncaught.
//!
//! The `then` function and the promise wrapper are shared by every task of an env (kept in the
//! env's registration record, released at its teardown); the thenable carries a number naming the
//! task's [`Slot`].
//!
//! Observable differences of thenable mode from deferred mode (workers, Electron and the other
//! thenable hosts only):
//!
//! * One extra microtask job per task, the one that calls `then`, at the first microtask
//!   checkpoint after the task is created. The task cannot settle the promise before it.
//! * That job runs with the task's promise as its resource, so `async_hooks` and
//!   `v8.promiseHooks` see one extra `before`/`after` pair for the promise, while it is still
//!   pending (standard behaviour for a promise resolved with a thenable).
//! * If the task completes before that job (only possible when its completion runs inside a
//!   nested event loop, before the outer callback drained its microtasks), the outcome is kept
//!   and `then` settles the promise with it. Kept outcomes settle at the next microtask
//!   checkpoint in task-creation order, not completion order, and the task's `finally` runs
//!   before its promise is settled. A kept outcome whose `then` never comes is released at env
//!   teardown.
//!
//! A `JsDeferred` settles from any thread, through a threadsafe function that env teardown can
//! cut off, so nothing is sure to come back to its state. In thenable mode its promise is made
//! by the same wrapper, and its state is a [`DetachedPromise`]: a slot that is not owned, so the
//! env-teardown sweep ([`release_env_promise_states`], run from the env's registration cleanup
//! hook) frees it, settled or not, with its resolving functions and the `deferred_trace` error
//! reference. On Node that hook runs before the threadsafe functions' close callbacks hand
//! their leftover settles to the callback with a null env, so those touch nothing. Only plain
//! numbers travel off the thread. The same differences as above apply, and the env's first
//! `JsDeferred` may pick its settle mode and compile the wrapper. A `JsDeferred` made in
//! deferred mode, or without the wrapper, keeps its `napi_deferred` as before (16 B leaked if
//! its env is torn down before it settles). If every clone is dropped unsettled first, the
//! abandon frees it (`release_deferred_pending`) and the promise stays pending, held by nothing.
