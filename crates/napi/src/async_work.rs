/// point never settles its promise — and it also never balances the emnapi waiting-request
/// counter, which brackets every queued work. On Node a nonzero counter keeps a
/// `MessageChannel` port referenced, so the process cannot exit either.
///
/// Nothing observable from JavaScript can stand in for this registry. The threadless archive
/// (`emnapi-basic-napi-rs`) resolves `napi_*_async_work` through the `@emnapi/core` JavaScript
/// plugins, but the threaded one (`emnapi-napi-rs-mt`) links the C `async_work.c` backed by the
/// uv threadpool — see `emnapi_link_library` in `crates/build/src/wasi.rs` — so there the wasm
/// neither imports nor exports those symbols, and the only brackets a loader could see
/// (`_emnapi_ctx_*_waiting_request_counter`) are shared with threadsafe functions. This crate is
/// the one choke point both flavors go through.
