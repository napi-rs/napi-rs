/// How the promise is made depends on the env (see `crate::async_work::promise`):
///
/// * On the main thread of Node and Bun, and on wasm, with `napi_create_promise`, as before
///   #3689. A promise still pending when such an env is torn down (process exit) leaks its 16 B

///   per-env JavaScript function, so no `napi_deferred` exists. A promise still pending, or a
///   settle still queued, when the env is torn down leaves nothing behind: env teardown frees its
///   state. This costs about 0.5 to 1.3 µs (about 10%) more JavaScript-thread CPU per
///   `async fn` call in a worker (release builds, Node 20 to 26), and is observable:
///   * one extra microtask job right after the promise is made, and one extra
///     `async_hooks` / `v8.promiseHooks` `before`/`after` pair for the promise (standard for a
///     promise resolved with a thenable);
///   * a settle that comes back before that job ran (only inside a nested event loop) is kept,
///     and settles the promise at the next microtask checkpoint;
///   * the env's first such promise may pick the env's settle mode (it reads
///     `process.versions`, once) and compiles the function (`napi_run_script`: one anonymous
///     script in the inspector);
///   * near the stack limit, calling that function can throw where `napi_create_promise` did
///     not. The exception is cleared and that one promise is made with `napi_create_promise`,
///     which keeps the old 16 B leak if its env is torn down before it settles. So does every
///     promise of an env that has no registration record of this addon, or whose host blocks
///     the compile.
///
/// Dropping every clone without settling (native targets):
///
/// * The promise of a `#[napi] async fn`, `Env::spawn_future`, `Env::spawn_future_with_callback`
///   or `AsyncBlock` is **rejected** when its task is dropped before it completed, for example
///   by a runtime shutdown:
///   `Error("task was cancelled before completion")`, `code` `GenericFailure` (what a custom
///   `AsyncRuntime` backend that cancels a task already did).
/// * A deferred of [`Env::create_deferred`] dropped on **another thread** was sent away, so its
///   promise went to JavaScript: it is **rejected** with
///   `Error("JsDeferred was dropped without being settled")`, `code` `GenericFailure`.
/// * A deferred of [`Env::create_deferred`] dropped on **its own JavaScript thread** (the common
///   case: `let (d, p) = env.create_deferred()?; step()?;` returns the error, so the promise never
///   reaches JavaScript) is **cleaned up at once**, inside the `Drop`, before control returns to
///   JavaScript: the threadsafe function is released, the trace reference and the thenable slot
///   are freed. In deferred mode (the main thread of Node and Bun) the `napi_deferred` is freed
///   too, by resolving it with an inert thenable (one extra microtask job and `async_hooks`
///   `before`/`after` pair, as in thenable mode). The promise is not rejected: it stays pending
///   for ever, held by nothing, so it and its awaiters can be collected. With a JavaScript
///   exception pending in deferred mode, the cleanup is queued to the JavaScript thread instead,
///   and the exception is left untouched.
///
/// A rejection is built and delivered on the JavaScript thread; with `deferred_trace` its stack
/// is the JavaScript caller that made the promise. Limits:
///
/// * A deferred of [`Env::create_deferred`] dropped on its own JavaScript thread is cleaned up
///   silently and stays pending **even when JavaScript already holds its promise**: dropped in a
///   later call, after its promise was handed to a JavaScript callback, or after it was sent to
///   another thread and came back (dropped inside a threadsafe-function callback or another
///   deferred's resolver). Settle it explicitly when JavaScript may await it.
/// * A deferred of [`Env::create_deferred`] dropped on another thread is rejected **even when its
///   promise never reached JavaScript** (a `?` after the deferred was sent away). Nothing handles
///   that rejection: Node reports an unhandled rejection, which ends the process with exit code
///   1 on the main thread and emits `'error'` on a worker (Bun does the same). Settle it
///   explicitly instead of dropping it.
/// * `Env::spawn_future`, `Env::spawn_future_with_callback` and `AsyncBlockBuilder::build` give
///   the promise to the Rust caller. A caller that drops it instead of returning it to JavaScript
///   leaves a promise that nothing can handle: when its task is dropped (or fails), the rejection
///   is unhandled, with the same result as above.
/// * In deferred mode the cleanup on the JavaScript thread calls `napi_resolve_deferred` inside
///   the `Drop`, so an `async_hooks` / `v8.promiseHooks` callback can run JavaScript there.
/// * On wasm, dropping does nothing, as before, also for the task of an `async fn` dropped by a
///   runtime shutdown: its promise stays pending.
///
/// A deferred that is neither settled nor dropped (for example one passed to `mem::forget`) still
/// holds its threadsafe function, so the event loop of its thread stays alive: the process or the
/// worker does not exit on its own. Only an end of the env from outside releases it. In a worker
/// (`worker.terminate()`, `process.exit()` in the worker, or the parent exiting) the env cleanup
/// hook releases the threadsafe function, and only the memory the leaked value owns stays
/// allocated. `process.exit()` on the main thread runs no env cleanup hooks: the process ends and
/// the operating system takes the memory back.
///
/// The settle-time callback (see [`JsDeferred::set_finalize_callback`]) does not run then, not
/// even when the promise is rejected: it is dropped without running, as before, by the last
/// holder of its slot (normally the thread that drops the last clone). Nothing user-owned travels
/// to the JavaScript thread with the abandon (a rejection carries only a tag),
/// because a host may never deliver it (Deno does not run the env cleanup hooks of a busy worker
/// that is terminated, and then accepts the call but never runs it).
///
/// A `#[napi] async fn` roots each of its `&T` arguments in its borrow scope. When the task is
/// dropped unsettled (runtime shutdown, a dropped future), dropping the settle-time callback hands
/// those roots to the env's custom-GC handle, which deletes them on the JavaScript thread, so the
/// values can be collected (on wasm the instance of an abandoned async `&self` method was still
/// seen alive after that; not investigated). Known limit: output of `napi-derive` older than this
