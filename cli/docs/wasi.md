# WASI targets and loaders

Use `wasm32-wasip1-threads` for the threaded runtime and `wasm32-wasip1` for
the threadless runtime. The historical `wasm32-wasi` and
`wasm32-wasi-preview1-threads` spellings are accepted as aliases for
`wasm32-wasip1-threads`; they retain the existing `<package>-wasm32-wasi`
package and artifact identity. Configuring more than one alias for the same
artifact set is an error.

## Selecting a WASI flavor in Node.js

The root Node.js entry prefers a native addon. When native loading is
unavailable, it tries local WASI loaders and then installed flavor packages.
Within each group the default order is threaded (`wasm32-wasi`) and then
threadless (`wasm32-wasip1`).

Set `NAPI_RS_WASI_FLAVOR` to a generated flavor identity to select it through
the root package:

```sh
NAPI_RS_WASI_FLAVOR=wasm32-wasip1 node app.js
```

The selector enters the WASI path without requiring
`NAPI_RS_FORCE_WASI`, skips every other WASI flavor, and does not fall back to
a native addon if the selected flavor cannot load. This makes the result
deterministic when both optional flavor packages are installed, including
isolated pnpm and Yarn PnP layouts. Use `wasm32-wasi` to select the threaded
flavor. An unsupported value reports the flavor identities generated for that
package.

Without `NAPI_RS_WASI_FLAVOR`, existing behavior is unchanged.
`NAPI_RS_FORCE_WASI=true` prefers the default WASI fallback chain but retains a
lazy native fallback, while `NAPI_RS_FORCE_WASI=error` requires some generated
WASI flavor to load.

The root package exposes deferred workerd and Wasm entries. In a Workers
project built by Wrangler:

```js
import { createInstance, dispose, instantiate } from '<package>/workerd'
import wasmModule from '<package>/wasm.wasm'

const binding = await instantiate(wasmModule)
```

Prefer these root-package imports. They resolve through the root package's
optional dependency and work with isolated package-manager layouts such as
pnpm and Yarn PnP. The existing
`<package>-wasm32-wasip1/workerd`, `./wasm`, and `./wasm.wasm` flavor-package
exports remain available when that flavor package is installed directly.

Wrangler's built-in Wasm loader selects module handling from the import
specifier's `.wasm` suffix, so Workers projects should use the extensionful
`./wasm.wasm` export shown above. This ordinary default-import form is
Wrangler/bundler behavior, not a portable Node.js Wasm import.

Node.js 24 and later can load the same export as a `WebAssembly.Module` with a
source-phase import:

```js
import source wasmModule from '<package>/wasm.wasm'
import { instantiate } from '<package>/workerd'

const binding = await instantiate(wasmModule)
```

On older Node.js versions, or when source-phase imports are unavailable,
compile the exported bytes explicitly:

```js
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'
import { createRequire } from 'node:module'
import { instantiate } from '<package>/workerd'

const require = createRequire(import.meta.url)
const wasmPath = require.resolve('<package>/wasm.wasm')
const wasmModule = await WebAssembly.compile(await readFile(wasmPath))
const binding = await instantiate(wasmModule)
```

The packages also expose `./wasm` for bundlers that explicitly configure the
resolved file as a compiled `WebAssembly.Module`. Both Wasm aliases include
TypeScript declarations whose default export is `WebAssembly.Module`.

`instantiate()` owns a module-local singleton and deduplicates concurrent calls
for the same `WebAssembly.Module`. Call `dispose()` before replacing that
module. Calls that begin while disposal is in progress wait for it and create a
fresh singleton after cleanup succeeds. The deferred loader automatically
starts singleton disposal when Node.js emits `beforeExit`; a later listener
that calls `instantiate()` observes that state immediately and receives a
fresh singleton after cleanup rather than exports that are being destroyed. If
the first singleton is still initializing, cleanup waits for that initialization
to settle before destroying its context.
`createInstance()` creates an independent instance and returns
`{ exports, dispose }`; call the returned `dispose()` when that instance is no
longer needed. Independent instances are not automatically disposed at
`beforeExit`, while initializing or after success, so retained exports remain
usable if a listener schedules more work; their cleanup ownership stays
explicit. The `./workerd` package export includes TypeScript declarations;
`exports` is typed from the addon's root package when napi-rs type generation is
enabled. Intentionally untyped packages expose it as
`Record<string, unknown>`, so strict TypeScript consumers can use the lifecycle
API without a broken import of the declaration-less root package. If
initialization fails and immediate context rollback also fails, the loader
retains that cleanup ownership so a later `beforeExit` pass can retry it.

The eager CommonJS WASI loader keeps its emnapi context alive for the process
lifetime. Node.js can emit `beforeExit` repeatedly when a listener schedules
more work, and cached eager exports must remain usable after every such cycle.
At the actual `exit` event, the loader makes one synchronous best-effort
`Context.destroy()` call so emnapi's synchronous cleanup queue can run.
Consumers that need deterministic cleanup before process exit should use the
deferred loader and call its `dispose()` function, or the `dispose` returned by
`createInstance()`.

When type generation is disabled, the generated browser root exposes the
binding as its default export. `napi new` also removes the template's
`index.d.ts` and declaration metadata instead of publishing stale template
types.

The deferred loader accepts only a precompiled `WebAssembly.Module`. It does
not fetch or compile bytes at runtime.

Generated WASI packages intentionally omit npm's `cpu` and `os` fields. The
module runs inside the host process, so `wasm32` or host-OS restrictions would
make npm reject a direct install or skip the optional dependency on otherwise
supported hosts.

`napi.wasm.initialMemory` is measured in 64 KiB WebAssembly pages. The regular
Node and browser loaders retain the historical 4,000-page (250 MiB) default.
The deferred `./workerd` loader defaults to 1,024 pages (64 MiB), leaving
headroom under workerd's 128 MiB isolate limit. An explicit
`napi.wasm.initialMemory` value applies to every loader, so keep it within the
target isolate's limit after measuring the addon's actual requirements.
