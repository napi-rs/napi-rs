// this addon) in `create_custom_gc`. Every Buffer/TypedArray/Error/FunctionRef/native-borrow
// reference released off its env's JS thread goes through it.
//
// References never travel through the TSFN: they wait in `pending`, and the TSFN only wakes the
// JS thread, with at most one wake in flight (`wake`). Node-API is called on `pending` only on
// the env's JS thread with the env alive, from three places:
//   1. the TSFN callback (`custom_gc`), while the env runs, at most `MAX_DRAIN` references per
//      call;
//   2. the registration record's cleanup hook (`CustomGcHandle::close`), which also moves the
//      phase to `Closing`;
//   3. the late sentinel's finalizer (`custom_gc_sentinel_finalize`), which moves the phase to
//      `Dead`.
// A reference is either with its owner or in `pending`, never both.
//
// Why not through the TSFN: at env teardown Node's `RunCleanup` first runs `CleanupHandles`,
// whose `uv_run(UV_RUN_ONCE)` still delivers queued TSFN items (up to 999 per dispatch) with a
// live env. Only then do the cleanup hooks run, and the TSFN's own hook hands every item still
// queued to the callback with a null env, where nothing can be deleted. One reference per item
// leaked all of that overflow (48 B each on Node). Now only a wake token can be queued, and the
// record's hook, which runs before the TSFN's, deletes what is pending.
//
// The late sentinel is for references released after the hook, while Node finalizes the env's
// wrapped objects: a `#[napi]` class instance whose field holds a Buffer or TypedArray drops it
// in its finalizer, on the JS thread, at env teardown. The sentinel is a plain object wrapped
// with `napi_wrap` and kept by a strong reference, so its finalizer runs only at env teardown.
// It is created before any module-init code, so it is older than every entry that code adds to
// the env's finalizer list. Node runs that list newest first (`RefTracker::Link` inserts at the
// head, and `FinalizeAll` finalizes from the head), so the sentinel's finalizer runs after every
// class instance finalizer, and before Node resets the plain references, so deleting them is
// still allowed. Bun runs its finalizers last first too (`NapiEnv::runFinalizers`). That order
// is not documented. If a runtime runs the sentinel earlier, or never, the references released
// after it leak, as they did before: nothing is ever deleted twice, or after the env is gone, so
// it is the old leak, never a crash. It is a wrapped object kept by a strong reference, not an
// external: Node frees an external's `ExternalWrapper` only from a GC weak callback, which never
// runs for an external still alive at env teardown, so an external would leak 48 B per env.
//
// What still leaks, 48 B per reference on Node:
// * a value still held when its env is freed (an `async fn` future still running, a static
//   cache, a value sent to another thread): after that no Node-API call can free it. Closing
//   that needs a registry of every live reference per env on the hot path, or a reference API
//   whose references the env frees at teardown (Node has none today).
// * on Bun, a value held in instance data: Bun finalizes instance data after every finalizer,
//   so after the sentinel.
// * on Deno, every reference still held at worker teardown. Deno runs the cleanup hook when a
//   worker exits or is terminated while idle, but finalizes no wrapped object there, so neither
//   the class instances nor the sentinel are finalized; a worker terminated while its JavaScript
//   runs does not run the hook either, so the references waiting in `pending` leak too. The
//   sentinel's own wrap, wrap data (a `Weak` and an `Arc`, about 40 B) and reference stay with
//   Deno's env.
// * on wasm, references released after the hook: there is no sentinel, because a strongly
//   referenced object would keep the whole emnapi instance alive.
//
// The env's registration record (`env_registration`) holds a strong `Arc` until its cleanup
// hook runs. After that, the first reference that waits for the sentinel hands one to the handle
// itself (`teardown_keep_alive`), which the sentinel takes back, so the handle and `pending`
// outlive every class instance finalizer. The sentinel's wrap data (`CustomGcSentinel`) holds
// only a `Weak` of the handle, and nothing waits for a sentinel that never runs unless a
// reference was released after the hook, so on Deno nothing keeps the handle alive longer than
// before. The wrap data also shares the sentinel's strong reference with the handle, so the
// finalizer deletes that reference even when the handle is already gone, which is the usual
// case: no value holds the handle after the hook. Otherwise every env would leak that reference
// (48 B on Node), because Node never frees a reference the addon created, not even at teardown.

/// before `Context::destroy` flips emnapi's `canCallIntoJs` to `false`. It is therefore the
/// last moment at which a background task may still reach its `JsDeferred`: afterwards
/// `napi_call_threadsafe_function` reports `napi_closing`, a settle from a task that is still
/// running traps the instance, and the promise it owned can never settle.
///
/// On every target `napi_register_module_v1` registers `thread_cleanup` with
/// `napi_add_env_cleanup_hook`. Node runs that hook while the env can still call into
/// JavaScript; emnapi runs it from `Context.destroy()`, after JavaScript calls are disabled.
/// This export is the pre-teardown barrier wasm lacks, and it performs the same teardown as the
/// hook, only early enough to be useful.
///
/// # Ordering this guarantees
///
/// 1. The loader calls this export. The environment is still fully active.
/// 2. A registered `AsyncRuntime` backend's `shutdown` hook runs and, per its documented
///    contract, returns only once every backend-owned thread, task, and blocking closure has
///    quiesced.
///    Tasks dropped by that shutdown reject their promises through the cancellation callback,
///    which reaches JavaScript from here.
/// 3. This export returns. Every settle produced on *this* thread has already been delivered —
///    the promises are rejected, their `.then` handlers queued as microtasks. The set of
///    settles left waiting in the threadsafe-function queue is complete: the backend is
///    stopped, so nothing can append to it any more.
///
/// # Delivery, and the part that still needs the loader
///
/// `napi_call_threadsafe_function` only *appends* to the queue; on wasm the queue is dispatched
/// by the host, and `@emnapi/core` dispatches a main-thread call from a *macrotask*, two
/// coalescing turns later. Calling this export and `Context::destroy()` back to back — with no
/// turn of the event loop between them — would therefore strand every promise, because
/// `destroy()` runs the threadsafe function's cleanup hook, which drains the queue with a null
/// env and discards the settles.
///
/// So a settle made on this thread while this export is running does not go through the queue
/// at all: it runs straight into the promise, with the environment still fully alive. That
/// covers `wasm32-wasip1` outright, and every `wasm32-wasip1-threads` task whose cancellation
/// runs on the JavaScript thread. A host that cannot yield — a raw synchronous
/// `Context::destroy()`, a Node `process.on('exit')` handler — gets those promises settled.
///
/// What it cannot cover is a settle produced on *another* thread, which has no way to reach the
/// promise except the queue. [`napi_wasm_env_cleanup_pending`] counts exactly those. A loader
/// that can yield must, after this returns, yield real event-loop turns until that count reports
/// zero and only then destroy the environment; the generated loaders do. A host that cannot
/// yield still cannot get that half of the guarantee — it is the documented limitation of
/// `process.on('exit')`.
///
/// The built-in Tokio path keeps `shutdown_async_runtime`'s existing best-effort
/// `shutdown_background` semantics: it starts the drain here instead of
/// after teardown, but it does not join Tokio's workers. Blocking on them would be the wrong
/// trade on wasm, where this runs on the only thread that can drain the threadsafe-function
/// queue and, in a browser, may not block at all. Addons that need the hard guarantee register
/// an `AsyncRuntime` backend, whose `shutdown` contract provides it.
///
/// # The runtime stays down
///
/// Calling this declares the environment to be disposing, and that declaration outlives the
/// call: the runtime is latched against restart until a *new* environment registers this addon
/// image. Yielding to the event loop — which the drain above requires — lets arbitrary
/// JavaScript run, and an addon export called from it would otherwise restart the runtime this
/// just quiesced, behind the back of a drain that has no way to see the new work. From here on,
/// `start_async_runtime` is a no-op and every runtime-backed call returns a promise rejected
/// with [`Status::Cancelled`](crate::Status) rather than starting work the environment is about
/// to destroy.
///
/// Synchronous exports keep working, with one exception: the built-in Tokio compatibility
/// helpers (`napi::spawn`, `napi::block_on`, `napi::spawn_blocking`) hand back a `JoinHandle`
/// or the future's own output, so they have no way to answer "declined" — they panic instead of
/// accepting work the environment is about to destroy. That is what they already did in every
/// configuration whose runtime the teardown actually drained; the latch extends it to the
/// combined `async-runtime` + `tokio_rt` build, where the built-in runtime is typically never
/// constructed and a post-barrier call would otherwise construct one. See
/// `tokio_runtime::refuse_tokio_helper_during_wasm_env_disposal`.
///
/// Repeated calls are harmless — the loaders guard against them anyway, and the env cleanup hook
/// that `Context.destroy()` runs later performs the same idempotent teardown.
///
/// # The two-phase form
///
/// This export waits: step 2 above returns only once the backend has quiesced, and on
/// `wasm32-wasip1-threads` the thread it waits on is the same JavaScript thread a running
/// blocking closure may be waiting for a turn from. [`napi_prepare_wasm_env_cleanup_begin`],
/// [`napi_wasm_runtime_work_pending`] and [`napi_prepare_wasm_env_cleanup_finish`] are the same
/// teardown split so a loader can put real event-loop turns between the two halves. This export
/// is exactly `begin(); finish();` — a host that cannot yield keeps calling it and keeps
/// today's behaviour, and a loader that has not been taught the split keeps working unchanged.
/// The barrier spans both halves, so the delivery guarantee above is the same either way.
///
/// A loader must feature-detect the split (`typeof … === 'function'`) and fall back to this
/// export, for the same reason it already feature-detects this one: `napi-build` and `napi` are
